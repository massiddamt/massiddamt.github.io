Hi, I am Matteo. 
I am currently a Post-Doc Researcher at Institute of Biomedical and Genetic Research (IRGB - CNR) in Cagliari, Italy.

I started my academic career as a molecular biologist, working with DNA analysis techniques such as extraction, PCR, RFLP, Sanger sequencing, and NGS.

Over the past eight years, I have specialized in bioinformatics, mainly focusing on NGS data analysis and the development of scalable and reproducible bioinformatics workflows using Snakemake.

During my time at CRS4, I contributed to the creation of a set of publicly available bioinformatics pipelines, now part of the solida-core collection.

From 2022 to September 2024, I worked at the University of Sassari (Department of Medical, Surgical, and Experimental Sciences). During this period, I collaborated with colleagues at IRGB-CNR in Cagliari, contributing to the development of GeneBANGS, a collection of reproducible bioinformatics pipelines, available on GitHub: GeneBANGS.

Since September 2024, I have been working as a post-doc bioinformatician at IRGB-CNR in Cagliari, where I am involved in multiple research projects. 

My main focus includes: 
• Transcriptome, mirnome analysis of CRC patients for the identification of prognostic markers. 
• Exome and genome analysis in projects related to the study of complex diseases.


Personal Interests
======
During my free time I like playing with my kids or go out for a beer with my friends.

Recently I started playing padel and I noticed I am a little addicted....

Apart that I also like music and playing my guitar.
