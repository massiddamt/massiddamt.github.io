## Abstract
Background: In Cri du Chat (CdC), cancer as comorbidity is extremely rare. In databases from Denmark, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, no cancer was reported; in Italy and Germany, four cancers were identified out of 321 CdCs. Methods: In a 29-year-old CdC patient, clinical investigations following hematemesis led to the diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). A high pain threshold was also observed. Conventional and molecular cytogenetic defined the size of the deletion, and exome analysis on the trio completed the molecular work. Results: Cytogenetic analysis showed a de novo chromosomal alteration: 46,XY,ishdel(5)(p14.3)(D5S28-) and arr[GRCh37] 5p15.33p14.3(1498180_19955760)x1. A quantitative sensory test demonstrated a high heat threshold. A 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/TC scan of the brain failed to detect reduction of metabolism in the somatosensory area or insular cortex. Exome analysis in the trio (patient and parents) failed to identify variants to be interpreted as a likely risk factor for EAC. Conclusion: We conclude that the presence of well-known risk factors (maleness, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, and Barrettâ€™s metaplasia) in a patient with very limited capability of expressing discomfort or referring clinical symptoms have been the main risk factors for developing EAC. At present, based on the available data, there is no evidence of any increased risk of developing cancer in CdC patients.
