## Abstract
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) detection has emerged as an independent factor in clinical and pathological cancer assessment offering a highly effective method for predicting recurrence in colorectal cancer (CRC). The ongoing research initiatives such as the DYNAMIC and CIRCULATE-Japan studies, have revealed the potential of MRD detection based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to revolutionize management for CRC patients. MRD detection represents an opportunity for risk stratification, treatment guidance, and early relapse monitoring. Here we overviewed the evolving landscape of MRD technology and its promising applications through the most up-to-date research and reviews, underscoring the transformative potential of this approach. Our primary focus is to provide a point-to-point perspective and address key challenges relating to the adoption of ctDNA-based MRD detection in the clinical setting. By identifying critical areas of interest and hurdles surrounding clinical significance, detection criteria, and potential applications of basic research, this article offers insights into the advancements needed to evaluate the role of ctDNA in CRC MRD detection, contributing to favorable clinical options and improved outcomes in the management of CRC.
